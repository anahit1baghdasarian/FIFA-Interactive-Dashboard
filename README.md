# FIFA InteractivemDashboard: Data Visualization Project

## Overview 
The soccer industry, both offline and online, holds significant prominence in the world of sports. Many enthusiasts transition their love for soccer into eSports, particularly EA SPORTS FIFA, known for its accuracy in reflecting real-world soccer. This project delves into the analysis of FIFA games over several years, providing insights into the attributes of different teams, clubs, and players, with a specific focus on the comparison between France and England. Hence, an interactive dashboard created in the scope of this project, which provides a comprehensive view of the analyzed data and facilitates deeper insights into soccer statistics and trends.

## Motivation
Motivated by the ongoing FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 and past soccer match records, this evaluation aims to explore patterns and statistics between two renowned national teams - France and England. Leveraging years of FIFA game data, the analysis primarily employs data visualization techniques.

## Research Methodology 
Official FIFA video game datasets spanning from FIFA16 to FIFA23 were utilized for analysis. These datasets, obtained from Kaggle, encompass statistics for thousands of soccer players, including attributes such as strength, height, weight, age, and various gameplay statistics. The analysis employs both qualitative and quantitative data analysis techniques, facilitated by R programming language and relevant packages such as ggplot2, plotly, tidyverse, and R Shiny.

## Literature Review
The project draws upon existing methodologies and practices in sports data visualization. While previous studies have explored visual representations of soccer data, many either employ complex techniques or simplistic visualizations. The project aims to bridge this gap by providing insightful and interactive visualizations accessible to non-professionals.

## Hypotheses
The central hypothesis posits that the quality of soccer is better in France than in England. Sub-hypotheses explore various facets, including player valuation, team performance, and player characteristics, aiming to support the overarching hypothesis through statistical analysis and visualization.

## Analysis
The analysis is divided into three main parts: Team Level, Player Level, and Country Level. Various visualizations, including barplots, nightingale rose plots, and radar plots, are employed to compare attributes between French and English teams, players, and countries. Statistical tests such as the Wilcoxon test are conducted to validate the hypotheses.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The analysis supports the hypothesis that the football level in France is higher than in England, based on comparisons of player valuation, team performance, and player characteristics. The findings align with real-world events, such as France's victory over England in the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. The insights gained from this analysis can be utilized for future predictions and further research in the realm of soccer analytics.
